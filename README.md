Question 1: Visualize Solution and PHP Coding
Your company would like to develop a reward system. The requirement is as below:
1. Customers will be rewarded with Points when Sales Order in “Complete” status.
2. Every USD$1 sales amount will be rewarded with 1 point, if the sales amount is not USD,
convert to equivalent amount in USD for reward amount calculation.
3. Reward amount will be credited into the customer account with expiry date, which is 1 year
later.
4. Points can be used for new order payment, every 1-point equivalent to USD$0.01.
Please provide the following:


1. Flowchart or UML diagram on the reward system
- Please find it in `flowchart` folder. 

2. Design MySQL database schema for this reward system
- Please find it in `db` folder. I assumed very simple redeem system for now. I did not concentrate on ordering part.

3. PHP functions
- Please find it in `class/order.php`.
